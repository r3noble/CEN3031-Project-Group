# CEN3031-Project-Group
## Project name: ClubHub
## Project members:
### Front end:
 - Jenna Sheldon 
-  Robert Noble
### Back End
- Cole Rottenberg
- Kenneth Krause
## Project Desctiption:
Our idea is an application that streamlines the connection between clubs and possible members. At the moment, clubs have to advertise on a variety of platforms, with no unification, and each requires different information.  Our application would allow clubs to have a profile, entering their single-time events as well as reoccuring ones, possibly with more features. Students would then be able to search by date/time for organizations that have events that match their needs. 
Ideas for expansion of features include profiles of students that can show what they are involved in, an ability to rate clubs/ events, and possibly an automated way of gathering event information.

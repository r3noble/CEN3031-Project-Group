# Sprint 2 Overview
## Work Completed in Sprint 2
- Integrated front end and back end to perform a simple (login or profile component)
### Front End
- Added a calendar to the calendar page that we struggled for a long time with in Sprint 1.
- Added a profile page for a user. (club to come later)
- Implemented a registration page that routes from the login page. (no button in the navbar in header file so had to route through login) Only takes in valid inputs from the user such as only allowing UF emails.
- Added a simple cypress test.
- Added unit tests.

### Back End

# Testing

## Front End Unit Tests
- added unit tests to each component with functi0ns (login, register, calendar, and profile)
- at the moment, most work- we are having trouble with out integration as described in the video


## Front End Cypress Test
Wrote Cypress test that involved an up-down counter with buttons, implemented the following checks to accompany:
1. Make sure counter initializes to zero every time
2. Makes sure it is possible to change the counter value to a specific number
3. Makes sure that the '-' button decrease the counter, and '+' button increases the counter
4. Makes sure that clicking makes a change event happen with the counter

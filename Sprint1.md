What issues your team planned to address
- The front end team planned on addressing a home page and the login page, with working tabs to navigate between the pages and a login that allowed 
the user to enter their credentials. The team also discussed a profile where the user would be able to see what clubs and events they have expressed
intrerest towards, as well as a calendar page.
- The back end team planned to address

Which ones were successfully completed
- The front end team successfully completed a home page, with a coulple working tabs (through routing), and the beginning of a login page
(not connected with the back end).
- The back end team

Which ones didn't and why?
- The front end team did not complete the profile page or the calendar page, as learning to implement routing took much longer than anticpated and debugging the home and 
login page used up the time for this sprint.
- The back end team

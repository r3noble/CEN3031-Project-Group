This exists because we cannot insert users with identical IDs into the testDB when running "go test -v"

USED TEST IDs:
    add_user: 81 (has to be 81, think it has something to do with random number generator in loginHandler)
    create_user: 001
    loginHandler: 010
    user_exists: 100
    getByID: 101

# ideas for how to implement/ brainstorming
- one app for clubs to put in their events
- interface for students to put in their availability and get back meetings that meet their needs
- bot to find data from different social medias?
- integrated rsvp (interested vs rsvp)
- integrated invite to clubs
- expand beyond ece
- login? would be cool 
-  to show num of active members, but also not have to login
 - rate an event? could be too cookie cutter
 - club account (invite only) vs member
  -excel sheet of registered clubs csv publicly available
